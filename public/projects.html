        One of the projects I've worked on is this website, which you can find the source code by going to
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/csfore/personal-site" target="_blank">here</a>.

        You won't find a lot of projects on my GitLab due to a lot of them never making it to the point of
        where I feel like they're ready to be released, although the most recent one I have done is one called
        dotDAP, which stands for .deb-ArchPackage, although as of late I've had to halt development due to me 
        switching to using openSUSE on my desktop and still using Windows 10 on my laptop.
        <br>
        <br>
        I do hope to start publishing my Vulkan projects once I've gotten the hang of it and make something
        I'm confident in, hopefully the tutorial project will be published within two weeks (as of 2022-01-09).
